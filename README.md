## About

This project demonstrates a complete, albeit simple, example of integrating
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) code into a web application. This is accomplished by compiling
Rust to [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/) or [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/). The
basic design pattern this project explores uses Rust to implement CPU bound portions of an app while
using existing web technologies to handle user facing, I/O bound pieces. The
[guide](https://davidmcneil.gitbooks.io/the-rusty-web/content/) explores this design pattern in
detail.

The project compares implementations of the
[k-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) algorithm (this example's
CPU bound task) applied to an image. The algorithm gives the resulting image a softened, painted look.

## Setup

### Dependencies

See the [guide](https://davidmcneil.gitbooks.io/the-rusty-web/content/setup-and-hello-world.html)
for steps on installing the dependencies.

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org)
- [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org)

### Running the Project Natively

From the top level of the project run

> cargo run

or

> cargo run --release

The resulting painted image can be found at _img/out.jpg_.

### Running on the Web

From the top level of the project...

Build the asm.js version

> cargo build --release --target asmjs-unknown-emscripten

Build the WebAssembly version

> cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-emscripten

From the _website/_ directory...

Install node dependencies

> npm install

Build the website (build results can be found in _website/dist_)

> npm run build

or build the website in release mode

> npm run build-release

or start a web server, website is served at [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/)

> npm run start
